# How to Stop the Integrated Driver Monitoring System

## Quick Answer
**Press the 'Q' key** (lowercase 'q' or uppercase 'Q') in either window to stop the entire system.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Option 1: Stop from Driver Monitoring Window
1. Click on the **"Driver Monitoring"** window to make sure it's in focus
2. Press the **'Q'** key on your keyboard
3. Both windows will close automatically

### Option 2: Stop from Lane Detection Window
1. Click on the **"Lane Detection Simulation"** window to make sure it's in focus
2. Press the **'Q'** key on your keyboard
3. Both windows will close automatically

## Important Notes

✅ **Either window works** - You can press 'Q' in any of the two windows

✅ **Window must be in focus** - Click on the window first before pressing 'Q' (the window should have a highlighted border/title bar)

✅ **Both windows will close** - When you press 'Q' in one window, both the Driver Monitoring and Lane Detection windows will close together

✅ **Alarm will stop** - The alarm sound will automatically stop when you exit

## Troubleshooting

**Q: I pressed 'Q' but nothing happened?**
- Make sure you clicked on one of the windows first (the window border should be highlighted)
- Try clicking on the window again and press 'Q'
- Make sure CAPS LOCK is off (lowercase 'q' works)

**Q: Can I close the windows by clicking the 'X' button?**
- Yes, but it's better to use 'Q' key for a clean shutdown
- Clicking 'X' might leave one window open

**Q: How do I know if the window is in focus?**
- The window border/title bar will be highlighted (brighter)
- The window will be on top of other windows

## Running the System

To start the system again:
```bash
cd "c:\Agent#66\Academical\Sem-V\M&I\M&I PROJECT"
& "C:/Agent#66/Academical/Sem-V/M&I/M&I PROJECT/.venv/Scripts/python.exe" integrated_driver_monitoring.py
```

Or simply:
```bash
python integrated_driver_monitoring.py
```
(if you're already in the project directory with the virtual environment activated)
